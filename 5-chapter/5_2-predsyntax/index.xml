We will still create propositions (statements that are either true or false) using logical connectives (∧, ∨, →, and ¬), but now we will identify the following from our English sentences
predicates: these will be the verbs in the sentences individuals: these will be the nouns in the sentences quantifiers: these will help us specify if we mean all individuals or at least one individual Domains Predicate logic involves expressing truth about a set of individuals. But the same statement might be true for one group of individuals, but false for others. Thus, we first need to consider which set of individuals we are discussing – called the domain.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/5-chapter/5_2-predsyntax/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
