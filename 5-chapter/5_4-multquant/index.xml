We will divide these translations into two categories:
Translations that involve several of the same quantifier (multiple universal quantifiers or multiple existential quantifiers) Translations that mix quantifiers In many of the sections, we will using the predicates below (which are over the domain of shapes):
isCircle(x) - whether shape x is a circle isSquare(x) - whether shape x is a square isRectangle(x) - whether shape x is a rectangle biggerThan(x, y) - whether shape x is bigger than shape y Several of the same quantifier First, we consider translations that involve several of the same quantifier. There are two ways we can translate such statements â€“ either using prenex form (quantifiers out front) or Aristotelian form (quantifiers nested).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/5-chapter/5_4-multquant/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
