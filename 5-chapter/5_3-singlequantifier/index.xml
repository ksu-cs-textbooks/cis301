These translations will involve a single quantifier.
Example: Predicate logic to English Suppose our domain is animals and that we have the following two predicates:
isMouse(x): whether animal x is a mouse inHouse(x): whether animal x is in the house Suppose we also have that Squeaky is an individual in our domain.
We will practice translating from predicate logic to English.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/5-chapter/5_3-singlequantifier/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
