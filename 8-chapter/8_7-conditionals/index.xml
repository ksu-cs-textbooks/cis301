This is because some executions will follow the if-branch and some will follow the else-branch. We will only consider programs with an if/else as opposed to an if/else if. However, you can simulate more than two branches by nesting another if/else inside the outer else.
Motivation Before we formalize the details of verifying a program with a conditional statement, letâ€™s motivate the topic with an example.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_7-conditionals/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
