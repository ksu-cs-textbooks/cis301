Specifically, we will study verification of programs with the following features:
Variables (booleans, ints, and sequences [which are like arrays/lists]) Printing and user input Math operations Conditional operations If and if/else statements While loops Functions The Scala programs we verify should be saved with a .sc extension. To show we are using Logika for verification, the first line of the file should be:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_2-logikaprograms/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
