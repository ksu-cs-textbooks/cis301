Assignments without mutation are those that give a value to a variable without using the old value of that variable. Assignments with mutation are variable assignments that use the old value of a variable to calculate a value for the variable.
For example, an increment statement like x = x + 1 MUTATES the value of x by updating its value to be one bigger than it was before. In order to make sense of such a statement, we need to know the previous value of x.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_5-assignment/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
