By the end of chapter 10, we will be able to prove the correctness of simple programs using a toy language that is a subset of Scala. While our toy language is not used in practice, the ideas that we will see to prove program correctness – preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, and global invariants – can be used to specify functions in ANY language.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_1-goal/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
