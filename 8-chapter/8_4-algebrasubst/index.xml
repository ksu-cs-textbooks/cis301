Verifying simple programs Before we delve into our new proof rules, let’s look at the process for verifying simple Logika programs (ones that include user input, variable initialization, and assignment statements using different operations). Here, the // --> lines are pieces of the verification process that you must add (or consider) in order to prove correctness of your program, and the other lines are the code of the program.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_4-algebrasubst/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
