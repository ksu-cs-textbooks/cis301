Division Recall that Z (int) is the only numeric type for Logika verification, so any division is integer division. This means something like 9/2 evaluates to 4, just as it would in Java or C#.
Check for division by zero Before doing division of the form numerator/denominator, either in a line of code or in a proof block, you must have have shown in a previous proof block that denominator is not 0.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/8-chapter/8_6-divmod/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
