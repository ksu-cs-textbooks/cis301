(We sometimes refer to this as semantic equivalence.)
An example of logically equivalent statements are q ∧ p and p ∧ (q ∧ p):
* -------------- p q # (p ∧ q) -------------- T T # T T F # F F T # F F F # F --------------- Contingent T: [T T] F: [F F] [F T] [T F] * ------------------- p q # p ∧ (q ∧ p) ------------------- T T # T T T F # F F F T # F F F F # F F -------------------- Contingent T : [T T] F : [F F] [F T] [T F]In these examples, notice that exactly the same set of truth assignments makes both statements true, and that exactly the same set of truth assignments makes both statements false.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/2-chapter/2_4-logicalequiv/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
