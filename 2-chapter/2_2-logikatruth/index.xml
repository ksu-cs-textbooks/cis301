Operator precedence Logical operators have a defined precedence (order of operations) just as arithmetic operators do. In arithmetic, parentheses have the highest precedence, followed by exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.
Here is the precedence of the logical operators, from most important (do first) to least important (do last):</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/2-chapter/2_2-logikatruth/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
