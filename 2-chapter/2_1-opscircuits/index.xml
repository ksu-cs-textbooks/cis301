This sets the stage for analyzing modern programs.
Logical operators There are four basic logic gates, with corresponding logical operators:
Meaning Logical Operator Logic Gate p AND q p ∧ q p OR q p ∨ q NOT p ¬p p IMPLIES q p → q In the above drawings, the input wires are labelled with the names P and Q.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/2-chapter/2_1-opscircuits/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
