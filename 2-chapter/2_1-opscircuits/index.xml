This sets the stage for analyzing modern programs.
Logical operators There are four basic logic gates, with corresponding logical operators:
Meaning Logical Operator Logic Gate p AND q p ∧ q p OR q p ∨ q NOT p ¬p p IMPLIES q p → q In the above drawings, the input wires are labelled with the names P and Q. The output that is computed is emitted from the rightmost wire which exits the gate. For these simple gates, it is possible to exhaustively test every permutation of potential inputs and summarize results in a table, called a truth table.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/2-chapter/2_1-opscircuits/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
