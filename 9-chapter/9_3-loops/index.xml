Loops are trickier to analyze than if/else statements, because we don’t know how many times the loop will execute. The loop condition might be initially false, in which case we would skip the body of the loop entirely. Or, the loop might go through 1 iteration, or 10 iterations, or 100 iterations…we don’t know.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/9-chapter/9_3-loops/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
