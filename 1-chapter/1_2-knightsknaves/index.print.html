While these puzzles aren&rsquo;t strictly necessary to understand the remaining course content, they require the same rigorous analysis that we will use when doing more formal truth tables and proofs. Plus, they&rsquo;re fun!</p><p>The puzzles in this section and the rest of this chapter are all either from or inspired by: <em>What is the Name of This Book?</em>, by Raymond Smullyan.</p><h2 id=island-of-knights-and-knaves>Island of Knights and Knaves</h2><p>This section will involve knights and knaves puzzles, where we meet different inhabitants of the mythical island of Knights and Knaves. Each inhabitant of this island is either a <em>knight</em> or a <em>knave</em>.</p><p>Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.</p><h2 id=example-1>Example 1</h2><p>Can any inhabitant of the island of Knights and Knaves say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a knave&rdquo;?</p><details><summary><b>-→ Click for solution</b></summary><p>No! A knight couldn&rsquo;t make that statement, as knights always tell the truth. And a knave couldn&rsquo;t make that statement either, since it would be true &ndash; and knaves always lie.</p></details><h2 id=example-2>Example 2</h2><p>You see two inhabitants of the island of Knights and Knaves &ndash; Ava and Bob.</p><ul><li>Ava says that Bob is a knave.</li><li>Bob says, &ldquo;Neither Ava nor I are knaves.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>What types are Ava and Bob?</p><details><summary><b>-→ Click for solution</b></summary><p>Suppose Ava is a knight. Then her statement must be true, so Bob must be a knave. In this case, Bob&rsquo;s statement would be a lie (since he is a knave), which is what we want.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s make sure there aren&rsquo;t any other answers that work.</p><p>Suppose instead that Ava is a knave. Then her statement must be a lie, so Bob must be a knight. This would mean that Bob&rsquo;s statement should be true, but it&rsquo;s not &ndash; Ava <em>is</em> a knave.</p><p>We can conclude that Ava is a knight and Bob is a knave.</p></details><h2 id=example-3>Example 3</h2><p>If you see an &ldquo;or&rdquo; statement in a knights and knaves puzzle, assume that it means an <em>inclusive</em> or. This will match the <em>or</em> logical operator in our later truth tables and proofs, and will also match the or operator in programmimg.</p><p>You see two different inhabitants &ndash; Eve and Fred.</p><ul><li>Eve says, &ldquo;I am a knave or Fred is a knight.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>What types are Eve and Fred?</p><details><summary><b>-→ Click for solution</b></summary><p>Suppose first that Eve is a knight. Then her statement must be true. Since she isn&rsquo;t a knave, the only way for her statement to be true is if Fred is a knight.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s make sure there aren&rsquo;t any other answers that work.</p><p>Suppose instead that Eve is a knave. Already we are in trouble &ndash; Eve&rsquo;s statement is already true no matter what type Fred is. Since Eve would lie if she was a knave, we know she must not be knave.</p><p>We can conclude that Eve and Fred are both knights.</p></details><h2 id=example-4>Example 4</h2><p>You see three new inhabitants &ndash; Sarah, Bill, and Mae.</p><ul><li>Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.</li><li>Bill claims that it&rsquo;s false that Mae is a knave.</li><li>Mae tells you, &ldquo;Bill would tell you that I am a knave.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?</p><details><summary><b>-→ Click for solution</b></summary><p>Before starting on this puzzle, it might help to rephrase Sarah&rsquo;s and Bill&rsquo;s statements. Sarah&rsquo;s statement that only a knave would say that Bill is knave is really saying that it is FALSE that Bill is a knave (since knaves lie). Another way to say it&rsquo;s false that Bill is a knave is to say that Bill is a knight. Similarly, we can rewrite Bill&rsquo;s statemnet to say that Mae is a knight.</p><p>Now we have the following statements:</p><ul><li>Sarah tells you that Bill is a knight.</li><li>Bill claims that Mae is a knight.</li><li>Mae tells you, &ldquo;Bill would tell you that I am a knave.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Suppose Sarah is a knight. Then her statement is true, so Bill must also be a knight. This would mean Bill&rsquo;s statement would also be true, so Mae is a knight as well. But Mae says that Bill would say she&rsquo;s a knave, and that&rsquo;s not true &ndash; Bill would truthfully say that Mae is a knight.</p><p>Suppose instead that Sarah is a knave. Then her statement is false, so Bill must be a knave. This would make Bill&rsquo;s claim false as well, so Mae must be a knave. Mae knows that Bill would say she was a knight (since Bill is a knave, and would lie), and if Mae was a knave then she would indeed lie and say that Bill would say she was a knave.</p><p>We can conclude that all three are knaves.</p></details><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
