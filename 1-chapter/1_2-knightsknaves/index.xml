While these puzzles aren’t strictly necessary to understand the remaining course content, they require the same rigorous analysis that we will use when doing more formal truth tables and proofs. Plus, they’re fun!
The puzzles in this section and the rest of this chapter are all either from or inspired by: What is the Name of This Book?, by Raymond Smullyan.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/1-chapter/1_2-knightsknaves/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
