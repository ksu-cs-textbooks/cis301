Note that in our Logika proofs, the implies operator is typed as __>: but is rendered as →.
Implies elimination Remember that → is a kind of logical “if-then”. Here, we understand p → q to mean that p holds knowledge sufficient to deduce q – so, whenever p is proved to be a fact, then p → q enables q to be proved a fact, too. This is the implies elimination rule, ImplyE, and we can formalize it like this:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/4-chapter/4_4-impliesrules/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
