In this chapter, we will learn the process of natural deduction in propositional logic. This will allow us to start with a set of known facts (premises) and apply a series of rules to see if we can reach some goal conclusion. Essentially, we will be able to see whether a given conclusion necessarily follows from a set of premises.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/4-chapter/4_1-intro/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
