Does it matter which approach we use? Will there ever be a time when two statements are semantically equivalent but not provably equivalent, or vice versa? Will there ever be a time when a set of premises semantically entails a conclusion, but that the premises do not prove (using our deduction proofs) the conclusion, or vice versa?</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/4-chapter/4_9-soundcomplete/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
