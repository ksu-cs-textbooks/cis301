In this section, we will introduce the notion of a contradiction, which occurs when, for some proposition P, we have proved both the facts P and ¬ P. This indicates that we are in an impossible situation, and often means that we have made a bad previous assumption. In Logika, we use an F (“false”) as a claim to indiciate that we’ve reached a contradiction.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/4-chapter/4_5-notrules/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
