In this section, we will consider the notion of termination – whether a function will ever finish running.
Partial correctness vs total correctness Up to this point, we have proved partial correctness for functions – IF the function’s precondition holds, AND if it terminates, THEN we promise that its postcondition will hold.
Example of partial correctness Consider the following version of our mult function, which uses repeated addition to multiply two numbers:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/10-chapter/10_6-termination/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
