Typically, we must include the following in our invariant:
If the sequence changes in the loop Describe what sequence elements have already changed in the loop (and what their new values are) Describe what sequence elements still have their original value Prove lower and upper bounds for whatever variable is being used as a sequence position (so we can be certain we will not go past the bounds of the sequence) State that the sequence size does not change (to reinforce that the variable used as the sequence position will not go out of bounds) List the sequence along with other changing variables in the loop invariant blockâ€™s Modifies clause If the sequence does not change in the loop Consider what we are doing with each sequence element as we look at them.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/10-chapter/10_4-seqloop/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
