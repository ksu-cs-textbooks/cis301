This means that if a function makes changes to a sequence parameter, then it will also change whatever sequence object was passed to the function. For example, the test code below passes nums, which has the value ZS(1,2,3), to the makeFirstZero function. The makeFirstZero function changes the first position in its parameter (seq) to be 0, which means that the nums sequence in the test code will also have its first position set to 0 (making it have the value ZS(0,2,3)).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/10-chapter/10_3-seqfn/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
