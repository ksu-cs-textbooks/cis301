In this chapter, we will learn the process of *natural deduction* in propositional logic. This will allow us to start with a set of known facts (*premises*) and apply a series of rules to see if we can reach some goal *conclusion*. Essentially, we will be able to see whether a given conclusion necessarily follows from a set of premises.
