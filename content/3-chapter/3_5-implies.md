In this section, we will learn when to use an implies (â†’) operator when translating from English to propositional logic. In general, you will want to use an implies operator any time a sentence is making a promise -- if one thing happens, then we promise that another thing will happen. The trick is to figure out the direction of the promise -- promising that if p happens, then q will happen is subtly different from promising that if q happens, then p will happen.

Look for the words "if", "only if", "unless", "except", and "provided" as clues that the propositional logic translation will use an implies operator.
