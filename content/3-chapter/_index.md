# Propositional Logic Translations

A *propositional logic statement* is a set of *propositional atoms* (statements that can be true or false) connected by logical operators.

In this chapter, we will see how to translate English sentences into such propositional logic statements, which will resemble the logical statements (like `p ∧ q → r`) we saw when working with truth tables.
