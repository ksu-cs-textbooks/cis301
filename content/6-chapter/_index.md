# Predicate Logic Proofs

Now that we have seen how to translate statements to predicate logic, we will learn new deduction rules for working with universal and existential quantifiers. We will be able to add those rules to our propositional logic deduction rules and show that a set of premises proves a conclusion in predicate logic. Predicate logic is also referred to as *first order logic*. 

As with propositional logic, we can use the Logika tool to help check the correctness of our new deduction rules. However, these new rules also exist outside of Logika, and we could express the same proofs with our rules in a different environment or on paper -- the concepts are the same.
