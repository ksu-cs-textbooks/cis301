This section will discuss how to prove sequents that use nested quantifers. We will see that the approach is the same as before, but that we must take caution to process the quantifiers in the correct order. Recall that quantifier precedence is from right to left (i.e., from the outside in), so that ∀ x ∀ y P(x, y) is equivalent to ∀ x (∀ y P(x, y)).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/6-chapter/6_3-nested/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
