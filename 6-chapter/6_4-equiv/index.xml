¬(∃ x P(x)) is equivalent to ∀ x ¬P(x) ¬(∀ x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃ x ¬P(x) The process of proving that two predicate logic statements are equivalent is the same as it was in propositional logic – we must prove the second proposition using the first as a premise, and we must prove the first given the second as a premise.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/6-chapter/6_4-equiv/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
