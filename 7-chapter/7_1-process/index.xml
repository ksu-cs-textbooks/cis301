In this chapter, we will use mathematical induction to prove several mathematical claims. When we reach the next several chapters on programming logic, we will see that mathematical induction is very similar to the process of proving correctness for programs with loops.
Domino effect To prove that a property $P(n)$ is true for an arbitrary nonnegative integer $n$ using mathematical induction, we must show two things:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_1-process/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
