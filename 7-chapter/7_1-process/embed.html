In this chapter, we will use mathematical induction to prove several mathematical claims. When we reach the next several chapters on programming logic, we will see that mathematical induction is very similar to the process of proving correctness for programs with loops.</p><h2 id=domino-effect>Domino effect</h2><p>To prove that a property
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> is true for an arbitrary nonnegative integer
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span> using mathematical induction, we must show two things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Base case</strong>. We must prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> is true for the smallest possible value of
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>. Usually this is
<span class="math align-center">$n = 0$</span> or
<span class="math align-center">$n = 1$</span>, but occasionally we will define a property for all values greater than or equal to 2, or some bigger number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inductive step</strong>. We assume the <em>inductive hypothesis</em> &ndash; that
<span class="math align-center">$P(k)$</span> holds for some arbitrary nonnegative integer
<span class="math align-center">$k$</span>. Then, we must show that the property still holds for
<span class="math align-center">$k + 1$</span>. In other words, we must prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(k) \rightarrow P(k + 1)$</span> &ndash; that IF
<span class="math align-center">$P(k)$</span> holds for some arbitrary nonnegative integer
<span class="math align-center">$k$</span>, THEN
<span class="math align-center">$P(k + 1)$</span> holds as well.</p></li></ol><p>How do these two steps prove anything at all? Suppose we are proving that a property holds for all positive integers
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>. In the base case, we prove that the property holds when
<span class="math align-center">$n = 1$</span>. Proving the inductive step allows us to say that whenever the property holds for some number, then it also holds for the number right after that. Since we already know the the property holds when
<span class="math align-center">$n = 1$</span>, then the inductive step allows us to infer that the property still holds when
<span class="math align-center">$n = 2$</span>. And at that point we know the property holds for
<span class="math align-center">$n = 2$</span>, so the inductive step again allows us to infer that the property holds for
<span class="math align-center">$n = 3$</span>, etc.</p><p>Think of mathematical inductive like a line of dominoes. The &ldquo;base case&rdquo; tells us that the first domino will fall, and the &ldquo;inductive step&rdquo; tells us that if one domino falls, then the one right after it will fall as well. From these two pieces, we can conclude that the entire line of dominoes will fall (i.e., that the property will hold for the entire set of numbers).</p><h2 id=summation-property>Summation property</h2><p>There is a well-known formula for adding all positive integers up to some bound,
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>:</p><span class="math align-center">$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2 + ... + n = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$</span><br><br><p>To see how this works, suppose
<span class="math align-center">$n = 3$</span>. We have that
<span class="math align-center">$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$</span>, and also that
<span class="math align-center">$\dfrac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$</span>.</p><p>Suppose instead that
<span class="math align-center">$n = 7$</span>. We have that
<span class="math align-center">$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$</span>, and also that
<span class="math align-center">$\dfrac{7(7+1)}{2} = 28$</span>.</p><h2 id=first-induction-proof>First induction proof</h2><p>Let
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> be the equation:</p><span class="math align-center">$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2 + ... + n = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$</span><p>We wish to use mathematical induction to prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> holds for all positive integers
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>.</p><br><br><p>We will refer to
<span class="math align-center">$1 + 2 + ... + n$</span> as
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(n)$</span> and we will refer to
<span class="math align-center">$\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$</span> as
<span class="math align-center">$RHS(n)$</span>. To prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> holds for some positive integer
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>, we must prove that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(n) = RHS(n)$</span>.</p><h3 id=base-case>Base case</h3><p>We must prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> holds for the smallest positive integer,
<span class="math align-center">$n = 1$</span>, that is, that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(1) = RHS(1)$</span>. The sum of all integers from 1 to 1 is just 1, so we have that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(1) = 1$</span>. We also have that:</p><span class="math align-center">$$
\begin{aligned}
RHS(1) = \dfrac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1
\end{aligned}
$$</span><br><p>We have that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(1) = RHS(1)$</span>. Thus
<span class="math align-center">$P(1)$</span> is true, so the base case holds.</p><h3 id=inductive-step>Inductive step</h3><p>We assume the inductive hypothesis - that
<span class="math align-center">$P(k)$</span> holds for some arbitrary positive integer
<span class="math align-center">$k$</span>. In other words, we assume that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k) = RHS(k)$</span> for our arbitrary
<span class="math align-center">$k$</span>. We must prove that
<span class="math align-center">$P(k+1)$</span> also holds &ndash; i.e., that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k+1) = RHS(k+1)$</span>. We have that:</p><span class="math align-center">$$
LHS(k+1) = 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) \tag{1}
$$
$$
= LHS(k) + (k + 1) \tag{2}
$$
$$
= RHS(k) + (k + 1) \tag{3}
$$
$$
= \dfrac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k + 1) \tag{4}
$$
$$
= \dfrac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} \tag{5}
$$
$$
= \dfrac{(k+1)(k + 2)}{2} \tag{6}
$$
$$
= \dfrac{(k+1)((k + 1) + 1)}{2} \tag{7}
$$
$$
= RHS(k+1) \tag{8}
$$</span><p>Thus
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k+1) = RHS(k+1)$</span>, so we have proved
<span class="math align-center">$P(k+1)$</span>. The inductive step holds.</p><p><br><br></p><p>We conclude that for all positive integers
<span class="math align-center">$n$</span>,
<span class="math align-center">$P(n)$</span> holds &ndash; that is, that:</p><span class="math align-center">$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2 + ... + n = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$</span><h2 id=inductive-step-explanation>Inductive step explanation</h2><p>In line 2 of the proof above we saw that
<span class="math align-center">$1 + 2 + ... + k$</span> was really
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k)$</span>, so we made that substitution. Then in line 3, we used our inductive hypothesis - that
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k) = RHS(k)$</span>, and substituted
<span class="math align-center">$RHS(k)$</span> for
<span class="math align-center">$LHS(k)$</span>. Since we had that
<span class="math align-center">$RHS(k) = \dfrac{k(k+1)}{2}$</span>, we made that substitution on line 4.</p><p>From lines 5 to 7, we did algebraic manipulations to combine our terms and work towards the form of
<span class="math align-center">$RHS(k+1)$</span>.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis301/js/clipboard.min.js?1736885349 defer></script><script src=/cis301/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1736885349 defer></script><script>function useMathJax(e){window.MathJax=Object.assign(window.MathJax||{},{tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]]},options:{enableMenu:!1}},e)}useMathJax(JSON.parse("{}"))</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=/cis301/js/mathjax/tex-mml-chtml.js?1736885349></script><script src=/cis301/js/theme.js?1736885349 defer></script><script src=/cis301/js/embed-iframe.js?1736885349 defer></script></body></html>
