In this chapter, we will use mathematical induction to prove several mathematical claims. When we reach the next several chapters on programming logic, we will see that mathematical induction is very similar to the process of proving correctness for programs with loops.
Domino effect To prove that a property $P(n)$ is true for an arbitrary nonnegative integer $n$ using mathematical induction, we must show two things:</description></item><item><title>Algebra example</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_2-algebraex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_2-algebraex/</guid><description>Claim: The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$. We will refer to this claim as $P(n)$.
Try it out Before proving $P(n)$ with mathematical induction, let’s see if the property holds for some sample values. The sum of the first 3 odd numbers is $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$. We also have that $3^2 = 9$.
The sum of the first 7 odd numbers is $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 49$.</description></item><item><title>Divisibility example</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_3-divex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_3-divex/</guid><description>Claim: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $6^{n} - 1$ is divisible by 5. We will refer to this claim as $P(n)$.
Try it out Before proving $P(n)$ with mathematical induction, let’s see if the property holds for some sample values. When $n = 3$ we have that $6^{3} - 1 = 216 - 1 = 215$. Since $215$ ends with a 5, it is clearly divisible by 5.</description></item><item><title>Set example</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_4-setex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/7-chapter/7_4-setex/</guid><description>Claim: If $n$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, then a set with $n$ elements has $\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ possible subsets of size 2. We will refer to this claim as $P(n)$.
Try it out Suppose $n = 3$, and our set contains the elements $(a, b, c)$. There are 3 possible subsets of size 2: $(a, b)$, $(a, c)$, and $(b, c)$. We also have that $\dfrac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3$.</description></item></channel></rss>
