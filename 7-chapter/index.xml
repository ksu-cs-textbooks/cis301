      <description>Mathematical induction allows us to prove that every nonnegative integer satisfies a certain property. In this chapter, we will use mathematical inductive to prove several mathematical claims. When we reach the next several chapters on programming logic, we will see that mathematical induction is very similar to the process of proving correctness for programs with loops.
Domino effect To prove that a property is true for an arbitrary nonnegative integer $n$ using mathematical induction, we must show two things:</description>

      <description>Claim: The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$.
Try it out Before proving this claim with mathematical induction, let&amp;rsquo;s see if the property holds for some sample values. The sum of the first 3 odd numbers is $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$. We also have that $3^2 = 9$.
The sum of the first 7 odd numbers is $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 49$.</description>

      <description>Claim: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $6^{n} - 1$ is divisible by 5.
Try it out Let&amp;rsquo;s see if the property holds for several sample numbers. When $n = 3$, we have that $6^{3} - 1 = 216 - 1 = 215$. Since $215$ ends with a 5, it is clearly divisible by 5.
As another test, suppose $n = 5$. We have that $6^{5} - 1 = 7776 - 1 = 7775$, which is also divisible by 5.</description>

      <description>Claim: If $n$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, then a set with $n$ elements has $\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ possible subsets of size 2.
Try it out Suppose $n = 3$, and our set contains the elements $(a, b, c)$. There are 3 possible subsets of size 2: $(a, b)$, $(a, c)$, and $(b, c)$. We also have that $\dfrac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3$.
Induction proof We will use mathematical induction to prove our claim for all positive integers $n$ greater than or equal to 2.</description>
